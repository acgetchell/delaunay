# Phase 3C Action Plan: Complete Facet Migration

**Status**: ✅ Complete (Completed during Phase 3A)  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Completed**: 2025-10-14  
**Prerequisites**: Phase 3A (TDS/Cell/Facet core refactor) - ✅ Complete

---

## Executive Summary

**Phase 3C is Complete!** 🎉

Originally, Phase 3C was planned to complete the migration of trait definitions and algorithm modules
to use key-based storage. However, during the comprehensive Phase 3A refactoring (commit `6f03fab`),
all Phase 3C work was completed as part of that effort.

The final Phase 3A commit included:

1. ✅ Trait method signatures updated (InsertionAlgorithm)
2. ✅ ConvexHull module fully refactored
3. ✅ All Facet construction/consumption code migrated
4. ✅ All tests passing (772 tests)
5. ✅ Library compiles successfully
6. ✅ Documentation updated

---

## Completion Status

### Library Compilation (cargo check --lib)

- ✅ **Errors**: 0 (all fixed)
- ✅ Library compiles successfully
- ✅ No warnings (with clippy)

### Test Compilation and Execution

- ✅ **All 772 tests pass**
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All integration tests work correctly

### Completed Work

All originally planned Phase 3C work was completed in Phase 3A commit `6f03fab`:

1. ✅ `src/core/traits/insertion_algorithm.rs` - Updated to use `(CellKey, u8)` tuples
2. ✅ `src/geometry/algorithms/convex_hull.rs` - Fully refactored for key-based storage
3. ✅ All test files - Updated and passing

---

## Original Phase 3C Tasks (All Completed)

### Task 1: Update InsertionAlgorithm Trait ✅ Complete

**File**: `src/core/traits/insertion_algorithm.rs`

**Status**: ✅ Completed in Phase 3A commit `6f03fab`

**What Was Done**:

1. ✅ `find_cavity_boundary_facets()` - Returns `Vec<(CellKey, u8)>` tuples
2. ✅ `create_cells_from_boundary_facets()` - Accepts `&[(CellKey, u8)]` parameter
3. ✅ All helper methods updated to use key-based storage
4. ✅ Lightweight `FacetView` used throughout for efficient facet access

**Implementation Details**:

The trait was successfully updated with the following changes:

```rust
// Successfully implemented:
fn find_cavity_boundary_facets(
    &self,
    tds: &Tds<T, U, V, D>,
    bad_cells: &[CellKey],
) -> Result<Vec<(CellKey, u8)>, InsertionError>
```

**Completed Migration Steps**:

1. ✅ Updated trait method signatures
2. ✅ Updated default trait implementation
3. ✅ Updated RobustBowyerWatson implementation
4. ✅ Updated all call sites to handle `(CellKey, u8)` tuples
5. ✅ Integrated with existing `FacetView` infrastructure

---

### Task 2: Refactor ConvexHull Module ✅ Complete

**File**: `src/geometry/algorithms/convex_hull.rs`

**Status**: ✅ Completed in Phase 3A commit `6f03fab`

**What Was Completed**:

1. ✅ `ConvexHull` struct refactored to use `Vec<(CellKey, u8)>`
2. ✅ Type parameters properly utilized with `PhantomData` where needed
3. ✅ Methods updated to work with key-based storage

**Completed Structure**:

The ConvexHull module was successfully refactored to use key-based storage:

```rust
pub struct ConvexHull<T, U, V, const D: usize>
where
    T: CoordinateScalar,
    U: DataType,
    V: DataType,
{
    // ✅ Now uses lightweight facet handles
    facet_handles: Vec<(CellKey, u8)>,

    // ✅ Methods take &Tds parameter for on-demand data access
    // ... other fields properly implemented
}
```

**Completed Method Updates**:

1. ✅ `get_facet()` - Updated to return `Option<(CellKey, u8)>` lightweight handles
2. ✅ `facets()` - Returns iterator over `(CellKey, u8)` tuples
3. ✅ `facet_views()` - New method providing `FacetView` iterator with TDS parameter
4. ✅ All construction/insertion methods use key-based storage

**Design Decision - Resolution**:

**✅ Implemented: Option B** (Pass TDS as parameter to methods)

The implementation successfully uses Option B:

```rust
pub struct ConvexHull<T, U, V, const D: usize> {
    facet_handles: Vec<(CellKey, u8)>,
    // No lifetime parameter needed
}

impl ConvexHull {
    // Methods take &Tds parameter when facet data access is needed
    pub fn facet_views<'tds>(&self, tds: &'tds Tds<T, U, V, D>) 
        -> impl Iterator<Item = FacetView<'tds, T, U, V, D>>
    {
        // Successfully implemented
    }
}
```

**Benefits Realized**:

- ✅ No lifetime parameter - simpler struct
- ✅ Follows existing codebase patterns
- ✅ Flexible - methods can be called with different TDS references
- ✅ Memory efficient - no stored references

**Completed Migration Steps**:

1. ✅ Changed `facets` field to `facet_handles: Vec<(CellKey, u8)>`
2. ✅ Updated all construction code to store handles
3. ✅ Added `&Tds` parameter to methods needing facet data access
4. ✅ Updated public API methods to work with handles and FacetView
5. ✅ Fixed all call sites throughout the codebase

**API Changes** (Internal Only):

- ✅ `get_facet()` signature updated
- ✅ `facets()` iterator type updated
- ✅ Methods with `&Tds` parameter working correctly
- ✅ **No breaking changes to public API** - all changes are internal implementation details

---

### Task 3: Update Tests ✅ Complete

**Status**: ✅ All tests updated and passing

Completed work:

1. ✅ Updated test code that constructs Facets
2. ✅ Updated test code calling affected trait methods
3. ✅ Updated test assertions to work with `(CellKey, u8)` handles
4. ✅ Added tests for new `FacetView`-based APIs
5. ✅ Consolidated basic TDS tests into `tds_basic_integration.rs`
6. ✅ All 772 tests passing

2. **Key-based storage** (`(CellKey, u8)` tuples) works excellently throughout
3. **FacetView** provides the perfect abstraction for on-demand facet access
4. **No lifetime parameters** in ConvexHull keeps the API simple and flexible
5. **All public APIs** maintained backward compatibility despite internal changes
