  accurate visibility determination even in the presence of numeric noise.

- **Fixed: Boundary facet edge case and improved debugging**

  [`34ae023663edc245139afb20339c27aed3295e1b`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/34ae023663edc245139afb20339c27aed3295e1b)

  Fixes a potential edge case where boundary facets with degenerate geometry could cause incorrect visibility testing results.

  Adds additional debug assertions and logging to aid in diagnosing boundary facet issues.

  Improves facet key lookup performance in tests by pre-allocating hashmap capacity.

- **Fixed: Improves numerical robustness in visibility test**

  [`34ae023663edc245139afb20339c27aed3295e1b`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/34ae023663edc245139afb20339c27aed3295e1b)

  Addresses potential numeric instability issues in the fallback visibility test within the convex hull algorithm. Replaces `from_f64` with `NumCast::from` for
  safer numeric conversions and
  adds an epsilon-based threshold adjustment. Also, corrects calculation of capacity for facet map.

- **Fixed: Improves facet boundary detection reliability**

  [`34ae023663edc245139afb20339c27aed3295e1b`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/34ae023663edc245139afb20339c27aed3295e1b)

  Addresses an issue where boundary facet detection could fail due to incorrect facet key derivation. This commit ensures that facet keys are derived from facet
  vertices, resolving inconsistencies and improving reliability. Adds debug assertions to help detect and diagnose issues. Caches facets per cell to avoid
  repeated allocation, improving performance.

- **Fix benchmarking by quieting output**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

- **Fix benchmarking by improving file handling**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Improves the baseline file handling logic in `prepare_baseline` to support tag-specific (`baseline-v*.txt`) and generic (`baseline*.txt`) baseline file names.
  It now also converts
  tag-specific baseline files to `baseline_results.txt` for
  consistency. The commit extraction logic has also been improved,
  with functions to extract SHA from baseline and metadata files. These improvements ensure that the regression tests can automatically leverage baseline
  artifacts generated by the `generate-baseline` workflow.

- **Fixed: Extracts baseline tag and prefers highest semver version**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Fixes the logic for extracting the baseline commit SHA from artifact files. It now propagates the baseline tag to the workflow environment, enabling
  version-aware baseline selection.

  It also prioritizes tag files with the highest semver version when
  multiple tagged baseline files exist, ensuring the most relevant
  baseline is selected.

- **Fixed: Handles baseline copy errors and improves baseline selection**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Fixes an issue where errors during baseline file copying were not properly handled. Now, if copying the baseline file fails, the script sets environment
  variables to indicate the failure and prints an error message to stderr.

  Also improves baseline file selection by preferring stable releases over pre-releases when both exist, and selects the highest pre-release if no stable
  release is available. This ensures more accurate and
  reliable benchmark comparisons.

  Additionally, includes the baseline source file name in the Github environment variables for better traceability.  Also, more lines are read from the baseline
  file when printing baseline metadata.

- **Fixed: Handles baseline summary read errors gracefully**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Addresses a potential issue where the benchmark regression helper would fail if it couldn't read the baseline summary file. Now, it gracefully handles such
  errors, prints a warning to stderr, and
  continues, ensuring the rest of the baseline preparation process can proceed, setting relevant environment variables.

  Also, fixes baseline tag propagation to workflow environments and ensures cargo bench commands capture output.

- **Fixed: Correctly detects stable baseline versions**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Fixes an issue where prerelease versions of baseline files were incorrectly preferred over stable versions when both had the same semantic version. This
  ensures that stable baselines are always selected when available.

  Also captures output when running performance benchmarks.

- **Fixed: Handles multiline env vars and sanitizes baseline tags**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Fixes issues with multiline environment variables by using heredoc format in GITHUB_ENV. Sanitizes baseline tags to prevent command injection by replacing
  unsafe characters and capping the
  tag length. Also, improves baseline file selection by using `packaging.version` for semver comparisons, handling prereleases and invalid versions gracefully.

- **Fixed: Sanitize environment variables written to GITHUB\_ENV**

  [`a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a090e1e8d9be1140da2e6f5139e3901c06e98f78)

  Ensures that environment variables written to the GITHUB_ENV file and the process environment are properly sanitized by removing carriage return and newline
  characters. Also handles None values correctly by converting them to empty strings. This prevents issues caused by unescaped characters in downstream
  processes.

  [`fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1)

  Refactors the benchmark workflow to rely solely on release baselines for performance comparison.

  This removes the generation of fallback baselines during pull request workflows, streamlining the process and ensuring comparisons are made against accurate,
  full-setting benchmarks.

  Updates the reporting to provide clearer guidance on how to enable performance regression testing via release tags.

  Increases baseline artifact retention from 1 year to 90 days to match repository maximum.

- **Improves performance baseline artifact retrieval**

  [`fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1)

  Modifies the workflow to improve the way performance baseline artifacts are located.

  The workflow now first attempts to find baseline artifacts associated with release tags by searching recent successful workflow runs of
  'generate-baseline.yml'.

  If no release-tagged baseline is found, it falls back to searching for any recent baseline artifact generated by the same workflow, regardless of its origin
  (e.g., manual trigger).

  This ensures that a baseline is found even if a tagged release is not available, or the baseline was manually generated.
  It also changes the failure message if no baseline is found, and provides improved instructions on how to generate a baseline.

- **Improves benchmark baseline handling**

  [`fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1)

  Ensures that expired artifacts are ignored when searching for performance baselines. This prevents the benchmark workflow from erroneously using outdated
  data.

  Adds more detailed logging about the baseline source, differentiating between baselines from artifacts and releases. The origin of the baseline (release or
  artifact) is now included in the
  comparison output and summary.

- **Improves baseline artifact lookup efficiency**

  [`fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1)

  Optimizes the benchmark workflow by caching baseline artifacts from recent successful workflow runs. This significantly reduces the number of API calls
  required to locate the correct baseline, particularly for release baselines. It also falls back
  to the most recent baseline artifact if no release baseline is found.

  Also, the `compare` command is executed using an `if` statement that determines whether the benchmark utils is installed as a
  module or an entrypoint to avoid errors.

- **Improves benchmark workflow reliability**

  [`fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1)

  Limits the number of workflow runs fetched to avoid excessive API calls and ensures that only unique, non-expired baseline artifacts are cached, enhancing the
  reliability and efficiency of the benchmark workflow.

  Fixes a bug where oldest benchmarks were used - GitHub lists newest first, so first one should be preferred.

- **Improves benchmark baseline artifact retrieval**

  [`fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fda43d76af0cf35061d2e70b32f1cfb24d4696b1)

  Optimizes the retrieval of baseline artifacts by pre-computing expected release baseline names and short-circuiting the search when a release baseline is
  found.

  This significantly reduces the number of API calls and speeds up the process, especially when release baselines are available.

  Also exports the `BASELINE_TAG` to the environment, making it available for subsequent steps.

- **Enhances changelog generation and release process**

  [`ea87521bc667d66ac9b23f07d1339087ce9f8d6f`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/ea87521bc667d66ac9b23f07d1339087ce9f8d6f)

- **Automates performance regression testing**

  [`ea87521bc667d66ac9b23f07d1339087ce9f8d6f`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/ea87521bc667d66ac9b23f07d1339087ce9f8d6f)

  Sets up an automated performance testing workflow that generates baselines on new releases, downloads the latest baseline artifact for PRs and main branch
  commits, and reports performance regressions.

  The workflow uses Python utilities for parsing benchmark results and comparing against the baseline.
  It also includes hardware compatibility checks and warnings.
  The shell scripts are updated to wrap the Python implementation.

  [`a50c978b9b6d9c67ac03ab3593eb8b9ea94102bb`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a50c978b9b6d9c67ac03ab3593eb8b9ea94102bb)

  Fixes the simplex orientation tests by using the correct vertex order to produce positive and negative determinants, ensuring the tests accurately validate
  the orientation logic.

- **Numerical consistency validation**

  [`a50c978b9b6d9c67ac03ab3593eb8b9ea94102bb`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/a50c978b9b6d9c67ac03ab3593eb8b9ea94102bb)

  This allows for detailed performance analysis and optimization of circumsphere containment checks.

- **Improves triangulation robustness and validation**

  [`ec9a9b28afefa923e55f26340d7011f249cd32d7`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/ec9a9b28afefa923e55f26340d7011f249cd32d7)

  Adds more comprehensive error handling and validation to the triangulation data structure, improving its overall robustness.

  Specifically:

- **Enhances error handling during cell creation and neighbor assignment, converting \`anyhow::Error\` to \`TriangulationValidationError\`**

  [`ec9a9b28afefa923e55f26340d7011f249cd32d7`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/ec9a9b28afefa923e55f26340d7011f249cd32d7)

  Updates triangulation validation to provide more informative error messages. Replaces generic error types with more specific variants where possible,
  clarifying the nature of the validation failure. This enhances debugging and troubleshooting efforts.

- **Improves NaN handling and hashing consistency**

  [`fe44e1aeadeaef081a6ac692f368f026654b4fd6`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/fe44e1aeadeaef081a6ac692f368f026654b4fd6)

  Refines NaN comparison and hashing logic for improved consistency and adherence to mathematical properties.

  This change replaces direct equality comparisons with `is_nan()` checks to align with IEEE 754 standards and ensures that NaN values are
  handled correctly in comparisons. It also standardizes the creation of NaN values using `f64::NAN` and uses `contains_key` instead of
  `get().is_some()` for hashmap lookups, enhancing clarity and reliability.

- **Fixes potential type conversion issue**

  [`928f42da2e16697423fdbc6385c0441a67e93d5a`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/928f42da2e16697423fdbc6385c0441a67e93d5a)

  Addresses a potential issue where unnecessary `.into()` calls could lead to unexpected type conversions when calculating squared distances.

  Also, disables markdownlint rule MD043 to allow for more flexible list formatting.

- **Fixes implicit conversion in example**

  [`928f42da2e16697423fdbc6385c0441a67e93d5a`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/928f42da2e16697423fdbc6385c0441a67e93d5a)

  Updates the example README to accurately reflect the implicit conversion of vertex coordinates.

  Corrects a type constraint in the coordinate conversion to ensure the correct `Vertex` type is used.
  This enables the smooth conversion of vertex coordinates to f64 arrays.

- **fix: update algorithm** [`bd2a0798d7bc8be981159a453c5a9ebdd8b0352a`](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay/commit/bd2a0798d7bc8be981159a453c5a9ebdd8b0352a)

  Updates the `Point` and `Vertex` structs to use `OrderedFloat` for hashing.
  This ensures that points with the same coordinates are always
  hashed to the same value, regardless of their original representation.
  The `Eq` derive was also removed from Vertex because it was implemented manually,
  but the derive will generate a conflicting implementation.
