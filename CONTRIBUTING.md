## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our [Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct].
By participating, you are expected to uphold these standards.
Please report unacceptable behavior to the [maintainer][maintainer-email].

Our community is built on the principles of:

- **Respectful collaboration** in computational geometry research and development
- **Inclusive participation** regardless of background or experience level
- **Excellence in scientific computing** and algorithm implementation
- **Open knowledge sharing** about Delaunay triangulations and geometric algorithms

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Rust** (latest stable version): Install via [rustup.rs][rustup]
2. **Git** for version control
3. **Python and uv** (for development scripts and automation):
   - **Python**: Minimum version specified in `.python-version` (enforced for performance reasons)
   - **uv**: Fast Python package manager - Install via:
     - **macOS/Linux**: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
     - **Windows**: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
     - **Alternative**: `pip install uv` (if you prefer using pip)
   - See [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for more options
4. **System dependencies** (for shell scripts):
   - **macOS**: `brew install findutils coreutils`
   - **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt-get install findutils coreutils`
   - **Other systems**: Install equivalent packages for `find` and `sort`

**Note**: Many development tasks now use Python utilities (managed by uv) instead of traditional shell tools, reducing the number of required system dependencies.

### Quick Start

   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account using the "Fork" button
   - Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delaunay.git
   cd delaunay
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. **Run tests**:

   ```bash
   # Basic tests
   cargo test                # Rust library tests
   uv sync --group dev       # Install Python dev dependencies
   uv run pytest             # Python utility tests
   
   # Or use just for comprehensive testing:
   just test                 # Library and doc tests
   just test-all             # All tests (Rust + Python)
   just test-release         # All tests in release mode (faster performance)
   ```

4. **Try the examples**:

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --example triangulation_3d_50_points
   ./scripts/run_all_examples.sh  # Run all examples
   ```

5. **Run benchmarks** (optional):

   just lint-config     # Configuration validation only
   ```

> **Tip**: Use `just help-workflows` for workflow guidance and to see all available commands.

## Development Environment Setup

### Recommended Tools

- **IDE/Editor**: Any editor with Rust Language Server (rust-analyzer) support
- **Linting**: The project uses strict clippy lints - ensure your editor shows clippy warnings
- **Formatting**: Use `rustfmt` for code formatting (configured in `rustfmt.toml`)

### Project Configuration

The project uses:

- **Edition**: Rust 2024
- **MSRV**: Rust 1.90.0
- **Linting**: Strict clippy pedantic mode
- **Testing**: Standard `#[test]` with comprehensive coverage
- **Benchmarking**: Criterion with allocation tracking

### Automatic Toolchain Management

**üîß This project uses automatic Rust toolchain management via `rust-toolchain.toml`**

When you enter the project directory, `rustup` will automatically:

- **Install the correct Rust version** (1.90.0) if you don't have it
- **Switch to the pinned version** for this project
- **Install required components** (clippy, rustfmt, rust-docs, rust-src)
- **Add cross-compilation targets** for supported platforms

**What this means for contributors:**

1. **No manual setup needed** - Just have `rustup` installed ([rustup.rs][rustup])
2. **Consistent environment** - Everyone uses the same Rust version automatically
3. **Reproducible builds** - Eliminates "works on my machine" issues
4. **CI compatibility** - Your local environment matches our CI exactly

**First time in the project?** You'll see:

```text
info: syncing channel updates for '1.90.0-<your-platform>'
info: downloading component 'cargo'
info: downloading component 'clippy'
...
```

This is normal and only happens once. After that, the correct toolchain is used automatically whenever you work on the project.

**Verification:** Run `rustup show` to confirm you're using the pinned toolchain:

```bash
rustup show
# Should show: active toolchain: 1.89.0-<platform> (overridden by '/path/to/delaunay/rust-toolchain.toml')
```

### Python Development Environment

#### Python Utilities for Development Automation

The project has transitioned from traditional shell scripts to Python-based utilities for better cross-platform compatibility and maintainability.

**Key Python Configuration Files:**

- **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines Python project metadata, dependencies, and tool configurations
- **`uv.lock`**: Lockfile ensuring reproducible Python environments across different machines
- **Python utilities** in `scripts/`: Modern replacements for legacy shell scripts

**Python Dependencies Management:**

The project uses `uv` for fast, reliable Python dependency management:

```bash
# Python dependencies are automatically managed
# No manual installation required - uv handles everything

# If you need to run Python tools directly:
uvx ruff format scripts/     # Code formatting
uvx ruff check --fix scripts/ # Linting with auto-fixes
uvx pylint scripts/          # Code quality analysis
```

**Integration with Development Workflow:**

- **GitHub Actions**: Python utilities integrate seamlessly with CI/CD
- **Hardware Detection**: Cross-platform hardware information gathering
- **Benchmark Processing**: Automated performance regression detection
- **Changelog Management**: Enhanced changelog generation and git tagging with Python parsing

**Migration from Shell Scripts:**

The project has evolved from shell-based to Python-based automation:

- ‚úÖ **New**: Python utilities (`benchmark-utils`, `hardware-utils`, `changelog-utils`) accessible via `uv run`
  with comprehensive benchmark processing, hardware detection, and changelog management functionality
- ‚ùå **Legacy**: Old shell scripts like `generate_baseline.sh`, `compare_benchmarks.sh`, `tag-from-changelog.sh` (replaced by Python equivalents)
- üîÑ **Hybrid**: Some shell scripts remain as simple wrappers (e.g., `run_all_examples.sh`)

**Benefits of Python Utilities:**

- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Better error handling** and structured data processing
- **Integration with GitHub Actions** for automated workflows
- **Easier maintenance** and testing compared to complex shell scripts

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Rust library structure with additional tooling for computational geometry research:

### Key Directories

- **`src/`** - Core library code
  - **`core/`** - Triangulation data structures and algorithms (Bowyer-Watson, boundary analysis)
  - **`geometry/`** - Geometric predicates, point operations, and convex hull algorithms
- **`examples/`** - Usage examples and demonstrations (see [examples documentation][examples-readme])
- **`benches/`** - Performance benchmarks with Criterion (see [benchmarks documentation][benches-readme])
- **`tests/`** - Integration tests and regression test suites
- **`docs/`** - Additional documentation and guides
- **`scripts/`** - Development automation (Python utilities, shell scripts)

### Configuration Files

- **`.codacy.yml`** - Code quality analysis configuration
- **`Cargo.toml`** - Package metadata and Rust tooling configuration
- **`pyproject.toml`** - Python development tools configuration
- **`rustfmt.toml`** - Code formatting rules
- **`rust-toolchain.toml`** - Pinned Rust version for reproducible builds

### Development Resources

- **`WARP.md`** - AI development assistant guidance
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** - This file
- **`REFERENCES.md`** - Academic citations and bibliography
- **`.github/workflows/`** - CI/CD automation (testing, benchmarks, quality checks)

For detailed code organization patterns and module structure, see [code organization documentation][code-organization].

## CI Performance Testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important: Rust Code Changes Trigger Lengthy Baseline Comparisons**

**Any changes to Rust code will automatically trigger performance regression testing in CI, which can take 30-45 minutes to complete.**

The benchmark workflow runs on changes to:

- `src/**` - Any core library code
- `benches/**` - Benchmark code  
- `Cargo.toml` or `Cargo.lock` - Dependencies

### **Branch Strategy Recommendation**

To avoid triggering lengthy baseline comparisons unnecessarily:

‚úÖ **Recommended**: Keep documentation and Python utility updates in **separate branches/PRs** from Rust code changes

‚ùå **Avoid**: Mixing documentation updates with Rust code changes in the same commit/PR

### **Examples**

**Good workflow:**

```bash
# Branch 1: Documentation updates only
git checkout -b docs/update-readme
# Edit README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.
git commit -m "docs: update contributing guidelines"
# ‚Üí No benchmarks triggered, fast CI

# Branch 2: Rust code changes (separate PR)
git checkout -b feat/improve-algorithm 
# Edit src/core/triangulation.rs
git commit -m "feat: optimize triangulation algorithm"
# ‚Üí Benchmarks triggered, but isolated to code changes
```

**Avoid:**

```bash
# Mixed changes (triggers benchmarks for trivial doc fixes)
git add README.md src/core/triangulation.rs
git commit -m "feat: algorithm improvement + doc updates"
# ‚Üí 45-minute benchmark run for a simple doc fix
```

This strategy helps maintain fast feedback loops for documentation work while ensuring proper performance regression testing for code changes.

just dev              # Quick cycle: format, lint, test
```

**Before committing:**

```bash
just commit-check    # Most comprehensive: CI + examples
```

**When working on performance:**

```bash
just bench-baseline   # Generate baseline
# Make changes...
just bench-compare    # Check for regressions
```

**Testing CI locally:**

```bash
just ci               # Simulate what CI runs
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Issue-Driven Development

Before starting work:

1. **Check existing issues** for similar problems or feature requests
2. **Create an issue** if none exists, describing:
   - The problem or feature request
   - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
   - Relevant mathematical/algorithmic context
   - Proposed solution approach (for features)

### 2. Branch Strategy

Create focused branches for your work:

```bash
# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For new features  
git checkout -b feature/feature-name

# For documentation
git checkout -b docs/doc-improvement
```

### 3. Development Process

1. **Make focused commits** with clear messages (see [Commit Message Format](#commit-message-format))
2. **Write or update tests** for your changes
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Run the full test suite** before pushing
5. **Check performance impact** for algorithmic changes
6. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request to the main repository

**Important Note on Git Operations:**

Per project rules (see [WARP.md](WARP.md)), **DO NOT** include `git commit` or `git push` commands in
development scripts. All git operations should be handled manually by contributors to maintain full control over
version control operations. This ensures:

- **User control** over commit messages and timing
- **Prevention of accidental commits** during automated processes
- **Compliance with project security policies**
- **Flexibility** in branching and merging strategies

Any automation scripts should stop at the point where git operations would be needed, allowing contributors to handle version control manually.

### 4. Continuous Integration

The project uses comprehensive CI workflows:

- **Main CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Build, test, lint on every PR
- **Benchmarks** (`.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`): Performance regression testing
- **Security** (`.github/workflows/audit.yml`): Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Code Quality** (`.github/workflows/rust-clippy.yml`): Strict linting
- **Codacy** (`.github/workflows/codacy.yml`): Code quality analysis using project configurations
- **Coverage** (`.github/workflows/codecov.yml`): Test coverage tracking

All PRs must pass CI checks before merging.

### 5. Code Quality Analysis

The project uses **Codacy** for automated code quality analysis across both Rust and Python code:

- **Configuration**: `.codacy.yml` in the project root
- **Rust Analysis**: Uses Clippy (configured via `Cargo.toml`) and rustfmt (configured via `rustfmt.toml`)
- **Python Analysis**: Uses Ruff and Pylint (configured via `pyproject.toml`)
- **Additional Tools**: ShellCheck for shell scripts, markdownlint for documentation, yamllint for config files

**Key Benefits:**

- **Unified Quality Dashboard**: Single view of code quality across all languages
- **Uses Project Settings**: Respects your local tool configurations (no duplicate/conflicting rules)
- **Pull Request Integration**: Quality feedback directly in PR reviews
- **Trend Tracking**: Monitor code quality improvements over time

**For Contributors:**

- Codacy analysis runs automatically on all PRs
- Quality issues are reported as PR comments
- The same tools and rules used locally in development (following WARP.md guidelines)
- No additional setup required - uses existing project configurations

## Code Style and Standards

### Rust Style Guidelines

The project follows strict Rust coding standards:

```toml
# From Cargo.toml - all code must pass these lints
[lints.clippy]
pedantic = { level = "warn", priority = -1 }
extra_unused_type_parameters = "warn"
```

Key standards:

- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have comprehensive doc comments
- **Error Handling**: Use proper `Result` types, avoid `unwrap()` in library code
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system for algorithmic correctness
- **Performance**: Consider algorithmic complexity and memory allocation patterns

### Mathematical Documentation

Given the mathematical nature of computational geometry:

- **Algorithm References**: Cite relevant papers or textbooks
- **Complexity Analysis**: Document time/space complexity where relevant
- **Geometric Intuition**: Explain the geometric meaning of operations
- **Numerical Stability**: Note floating-point considerations

### Code Organization

Follow the patterns documented in [code organization documentation][code-organization]:

1. Module documentation (`//!` comments)
2. Imports (organized by source)
3. Error types (using `thiserror`)
4. Convenience macros and helpers
5. Struct definitions (with Builder pattern)
6. Core implementations
7. Trait implementations
8. Tests (comprehensive with subsections)

## Testing

### Test Categories

The project maintains comprehensive test coverage:

   #[cfg(test)]
   mod tests {
       use super::*;

       #[test]
       fn test_specific_functionality() {
           // Test implementation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Property-Based Tests**: For geometric algorithms

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_geometric_property() {
       // Test that geometric invariants hold
   }
   ```

3. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and special cases

   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_degenerate_cases() {
       // Test edge cases like collinear points
   }
   ```

### Test Data and Reproducibility

- Use **fixed random seeds** for reproducible tests
- Include tests for **various dimensions** (2D, 3D, 4D, etc.)
- Test with **different data distributions** (uniform, clustered, etc.)
- Include **regression tests** for fixed bugs

## Documentation

2. **Examples**: Comprehensive examples in `examples/` directory
3. **User Guides**: High-level documentation in `docs/`
4. **Contributing Guides**: Development-focused documentation

### Writing Good Documentation

- **Start with purpose**: What does this function/struct/module do?
- **Explain parameters**: What do generic parameters represent?
- **Provide examples**: Show typical usage patterns
- **Note constraints**: Preconditions, postconditions, invariants
- **Reference theory**: Link to relevant mathematical concepts

### Documentation Commands

```bash
# Generate and view documentation
cargo doc --open

# Test documentation examples
just test             # Includes doc tests

# Check documentation coverage and validate
just doc-check        # Validates documentation builds for crates.io
```

///
/// This implementation extends the original algorithm to d-dimensions and includes
/// robust geometric predicates for numerical stability.
```

### Maintaining Academic Standards

As contributors to a computational geometry library:

- **Respect intellectual property**: Always cite sources for algorithms and ideas
- **Verify mathematical correctness**: Ensure implementations match published algorithms
- **Test against known results**: Use standard test cases from literature when possible
- **Document assumptions**: Note any mathematical assumptions or constraints

For comprehensive bibliographic information, see [REFERENCES.md](REFERENCES.md).

## Performance and Benchmarking

Performance is crucial for computational geometry algorithms.

### Benchmark Infrastructure

The project includes comprehensive benchmarking:

- **Location**: `benches/` directory with detailed [README][benches-readme]
- **Framework**: Criterion with allocation tracking
- **Coverage**: Small-scale triangulations across dimensions
- **Automated Baselines**: Performance baselines are automatically generated on releases

### Performance Testing Workflow

**For development and manual testing:**

```bash
# Run benchmarks directly
just bench

# Run all examples to verify performance
just examples
```

**Note**: The project uses an **automated performance baseline system**:

- **Automatic baseline generation**: Baselines are created automatically when git tags are pushed via GitHub Actions
- **CI regression testing**: Performance regressions are detected automatically in PRs against the latest baseline
- **Hardware compatibility**: The system detects hardware differences and provides warnings when comparing across different configurations
- **5% regression threshold**: CI fails if performance degrades by more than 5%

The old shell scripts (`generate_baseline.sh`, `compare_benchmarks.sh`) mentioned in some documentation have been
**replaced** with Python utilities that integrate with GitHub Actions for automated baseline management.

### Performance Guidelines

- **Algorithmic Complexity**: Document and optimize time/space complexity
- **Memory Allocation**: Minimize unnecessary allocations
- **Numerical Stability**: Balance performance with numerical accuracy
- **Regression Detection**: CI fails on >5% performance regressions
- **Hardware Awareness**: Consider performance implications across different hardware configurations

See [scripts documentation][scripts-readme] for detailed benchmarking workflows and the [WARP.md](WARP.md) file
for implementation details of the automated baseline system.
