# Code of Conduct

## Our Principles of Community

The [delaunay][delaunay-lib] computational geometry library community is founded on the [UC Davis Principles of Community][uc-davis-principles],
adapted for our collaborative open-source scientific computing environment. We are committed to fostering an inclusive community that
advances computational geometry research and applications.

### We affirm the inherent dignity in all of us

Every person has value and deserves to be treated with respect and courtesy, regardless of their background, experience level, or
contributions to the project. We recognize that contributors come from diverse academic, professional, and personal backgrounds,
bringing different perspectives that strengthen our community.

### We strive for excellence in our teaching and learning, research and scholarship

We are committed to:

- **High-quality code**: Writing well-documented, tested, and maintainable implementations of geometric algorithms
- **Rigorous validation**: Ensuring our triangulation algorithms are mathematically sound and computationally robust  
- **Knowledge sharing**: Providing clear documentation, examples, and educational resources about Delaunay triangulations
- **Continuous improvement**: Welcoming feedback, bug reports, and suggestions for enhancement
- **Academic integrity**: Properly attributing research, algorithms, and code contributions

### We acknowledge that we are part of a larger community

Our work builds upon decades of computational geometry research. We:

- Acknowledge and cite the mathematical foundations our library relies upon
- Respect the broader Rust ecosystem and follow community conventions
- Contribute back to the computational geometry and open-source communities
- Collaborate respectfully with researchers, students, and practitioners worldwide
- Maintain compatibility and interoperability with related libraries and tools

### We act with integrity and honesty

In all our interactions, we:

- Provide accurate information about the library's capabilities and limitations
- Acknowledge when we don't know something or need help
- Report bugs and issues honestly and constructively
- Give credit where credit is due for contributions and ideas
- Are transparent about our decision-making processes

### We value open expression and constructive dialog

We encourage:

- **Technical discussions** about algorithmic approaches, performance optimizations, and implementation details
- **Questions** from newcomers to computational geometry or Rust programming
- **Constructive criticism** of code, documentation, and design decisions  
- **Diverse perspectives** on problem-solving and research applications
- **Respectful debate** about technical tradeoffs and design choices

We do this through:

- Clear, respectful communication in issues, pull requests, and discussions
- Patient explanation of complex mathematical concepts
- Thoughtful code reviews that help improve quality
- Constructive feedback on documentation and examples

### We are respectful and inclusive in our words and actions

We create an inclusive environment by:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the advancement of the field
- Being patient with those learning computational geometry concepts
- Avoiding jargon when simpler explanations suffice
- Providing multiple ways to engage (code, documentation, examples, testing)

### We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or retaliation

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination based on any personal characteristics
- Disrespectful or unprofessional language or behavior
- Personal attacks or ad hominem arguments in technical discussions  
- Deliberately excluding or discouraging participation based on background or experience
- Publishing private information without consent
- Academic misconduct, including plagiarism or misrepresentation of contributions

## Community Guidelines

### Reporting Concerns

If you experience or witness behavior that doesn't align with these principles, you have several options:

1. **Address it directly** (if you feel comfortable) - Sometimes a gentle, respectful conversation can resolve misunderstandings
2. **Contact the [maintainer][maintainer]** - Email to discuss the situation
3. **Open a GitHub issue** - For public discussions about community behavior or policy

### What to Expect

When you reach out:

- I will make a good faith effort to respond when I am able
- I will treat all reports with respect and discretion
- I aim to understand all perspectives before taking any action
- My primary goal is maintaining a productive, welcoming environment for everyone

### Possible Responses

Depending on the situation, responses might include:

- A private conversation to clarify expectations
- Mediation between community members
- Public clarification of community standards
- Moderation of specific content (hiding, editing, or removing inappropriate posts)
- In serious cases, temporary or permanent restrictions on participation

### Limitations

Please understand that:

- This is an open-source project maintained primarily by volunteers
- Response times will vary based on availability and other commitments
- I am not a professional mediator or legal expert
- For serious legal matters, you may need to contact appropriate authorities
- The focus is on maintaining a productive technical community, not resolving all interpersonal conflicts

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, releases)
- Code reviews and technical communications  
- Conference presentations about the library
- Academic publications referencing this work
- Email communications with maintainers
- Social media discussions about the project

## Evolution

This Code of Conduct may be updated as the community grows and evolves. Changes will be discussed openly and community input is welcome.

## Acknowledgment

These principles are adapted from the [UC Davis Principles of Community][uc-davis-principles], which were developed
through a collaborative process involving the entire UC Davis community. We thank UC Davis for providing this thoughtful framework
for inclusive community building.
