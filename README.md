D-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in [Rust], inspired by [CGAL].

## üìê Introduction

This library implements d-dimensional Delaunay triangulations in [Rust]. It is
inspired by [CGAL], which is a [C++] library for computational geometry,
and [Spade], a [Rust] library that implements 2D [Delaunay triangulations],
[Constrained Delaunay triangulations], and [Voronoi diagrams]. The goal of this library is to provide a
lightweight alternative to [CGAL] for the [Rust] ecosystem.

## ‚ú® Features

- [x]  Copy-able data types associated with vertices and cells (integers, floats, chars, custom enums)
- [x]  d-dimensional [Delaunay triangulations]
- [x]  d-dimensional [Convex hulls]
- [x]  Serialization/Deserialization of all data structures to/from [JSON]
- [x]  Tested for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-dimensional triangulations

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## üöß Project History

This crate was originally maintained at [https://github.com/oovm/shape-rs](https://github.com/oovm/shape-rs) through version `0.1.0`.
The original implementation provided basic Delaunay triangulation functionality.

Starting with version `0.3.4`, maintenance transferred to [this repository](https://github.com/acgetchell/delaunay), which hosts a completely
rewritten d-dimensional implementation focused on computational geometry research applications.
