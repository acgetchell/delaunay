# Proptest configuration for delaunay
#
# This sets the default number of test cases for all property-based tests.
# The default proptest value is 256, which is excessive for our complex
# triangulation construction tests (each case builds a full 3D-5D triangulation
# with flip-based repair).
#
# Override via environment variable: PROPTEST_CASES=64 cargo test

# Number of test cases to run per property test
cases = 32

# Maximum number of shrink iterations when a test fails
# (keep default of 1024)
# max_shrink_iters = 1024
