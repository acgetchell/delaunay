# Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating various features and
capabilities of the delaunay library.

## Performance Considerations

⚠️ **Important**: Examples may run noticeably slower in debug mode. For optimal performance, run examples in release mode:

```bash
# Recommended: Run in release mode for better performance
cargo run --release --example <example_name>

# Debug mode (slower, but includes debug symbols)
cargo run --example <example_name>
```

Release mode provides:

- **Faster execution** (often up to 10-100x speedup for geometric algorithms)
- **More accurate performance measurements**
- **Better representation of production performance**
- **Optimized floating-point operations**

## Available Examples

### 1. Point Comparison and Hashing (`point_comparison_and_hashing.rs`)

Demonstrates the robust comparison and hashing behavior of the Point struct,
with special emphasis on handling of NaN (Not a Number) and infinity values.

**Key Features:**

- **NaN-aware equality**: Unlike the IEEE 754 standard where NaN ≠ NaN, our
  Point implementation treats NaN values as equal to themselves for
  consistent behavior in data structures.
- **Consistent hashing**: Points with identical coordinates (including NaN)
  produce the same hash value, enabling reliable use in HashMap and HashSet.
- **Mathematical properties**: Equality satisfies reflexivity, symmetry, and
  transitivity.
- **Special value handling**: Proper comparison of infinity, negative infinity,
  and zero values.

**Run with:** `cargo run --release --example point_comparison_and_hashing`
[View source](./point_comparison_and_hashing.rs)

### 2. Into/From Conversions Example (`into_from_conversions.rs`)

Demonstrates ergonomic conversions using Rust's `Into`/`From` traits,
showing how vertices and points can be converted to coordinate arrays
using Rust's `Into`/`From` traits.

**Key Features:**

- **Vertex to coordinate conversion**: Owned vertices and references
  convert to coordinate arrays via `Into`/`From`
- **Point to coordinate conversion**: Owned points and references
  convert to coordinate arrays via `Into`/`From`
- **Type safety**: All conversions are compile-time checked and type-safe
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: No runtime overhead for conversions
- **Ergonomic syntax**: Cleaner, more readable code compared to explicit
  coordinate access

**Usage Examples:**

```rust
// From owned vertex
let coords: [f64; 3] = vertex.into();

// From vertex reference (preserves original)
let coords: [f64; 3] = (&vertex).into();

// From owned point
let coords: [f64; 3] = point.into();

// From point reference (preserves original)
let coords: [f64; 3] = (&point).into();
```

**Run with:** `cargo run --release --example into_from_conversions`
