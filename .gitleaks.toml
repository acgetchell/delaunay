# This configuration allowlists known false positives where hex literals
# are used as benign test constants for facet key formatting validation.
# These are not secrets but rather mock data used in unit tests.

# regexes = ['''0xdead_beef_cafe_babe''']
# # Note: avoid file-level path allowlists; they mask unrelated leaks.
